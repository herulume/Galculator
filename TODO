Galculator is a prototype. Many things are still missing:

* Indirect equality tactics in proofs
* Deal with implications
* Validate identifiers and locate conflicts
* Saving of proofs
* Relators
* Free-theorems
* Help menu
* Documentation (Haddock and manual)
* Tests

Improvements:
* Remove many (once ...) (very poor definition)

Possible bugs:
* Type equality in type annotations
* Type equality in safe cast of DEF

Ideas:
* Algebraic manipulation of rewriting strategies in order to simplify them and
  identify possible non-termination situations.
* Automatically classify the rules according with the multiplicity of symbols.
* Proof steps seen as relations and thus proofs can be rewriten and simplified.
